    Let’s work through transcribing the French sentence "Des ours à la porte, avez-vous laissé les
    poubelles dehors ?" into Japanese step by step. I’ll provide clues to help you, and you can try
    to piece it together. If you get stuck, let me know, and I’ll give more hints!

    ### Step 1: Understanding the Sentence
    The sentence has two parts:
    1. "Des ours à la porte" – This describes a situation: "Bears at the door."
    2. "Avez-vous laissé les poubelles dehors ?" – This is a question: "Have you left the trash
    outside?"

    In Japanese, we’ll need to connect these ideas naturally, likely with a structure that implies a
    cause or observation (bears at the door) and then a question (about the trash).

    ### Step 2: Vocabulary Table
    Here’s a table with key words in their dictionary form (verbs, nouns, adverbs, adjectives only).
    You’ll need to figure out the particles and conjugations.

    | Japanese | Romaji | French |
    |----------|----------|----------------|
    | 熊 | kuma | ours (bear) |
    | 門 | mon | porte (gate/door) |
    | 置く | oku | laisser (to place/leave) |
    | ゴミ箱 | gomibako | poubelle (trash can) |
    | 外 | soto | dehors (outside) |

    ### Step 3: Clues for Transcription
    #### Part 1: "Des ours à la porte" (Bears at the door)
    - "Bears" (熊) is the subject. What particle marks the subject in Japanese?
    - "At the door" (門) is a location. What particle do you use for location with nouns like this?
    - You might need a plural marker for "bears" – in Japanese, nouns don’t change for plural, but
    context or a word like "some" could help. For simplicity, we’ll assume it’s clear from context
    here.
    - Think about how to say "there are bears at the door" – you might need a verb like "to be" (いる
    for living things), but since it’s dictionary form in the table, I’ll let you decide if it fits.
    #### Part 2: "Avez-vous laissé les poubelles dehors ?" (Have you left the trash outside?)
    - "Trash cans" (ゴミ箱) is the object. What particle marks the object of an action?
    - "To leave" (置く) is the verb. This is a past-tense question in French ("avez-vous laissé" =
    "have you left"). How do you make a verb past tense in Japanese? (Hint: dictionary form ends in
    -u, past ends in something else.)
    - "Outside" (外) is a location. What particle shows where the action happens?
    - "Have you…?" – How do you make a question in Japanese? (Hint: It’s simple, often just a
    particle at the end.)

    ### Step 4: Possible Sentence Structure
    Here’s a natural Japanese structure you can follow:
    - [Subject + particle] [Location + particle] [Verb for "to be"] , [Object + particle] [Location
    + particle] [Verb in past tense + question particle]?
    This could look like:
    "[Bears] [at the door] [are], [trash] [outside] [did you leave]?"
