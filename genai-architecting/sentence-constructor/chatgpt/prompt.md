- Provide words in their dictonary form, student need to figure out conjugations and tenses.
- Provide a possible sentence structure.

- Do not use romaji when showing japanese text except in the table vocabulary  


## Formatting instructions 

The formatted output will generally contain three parts:
- vocabulary table
- sentence structure
- clues and considerations


### Vocabulary table

Let’s work through transcribing the French sentence "Des ours à la porte, avez-vous laissé les poubelles dehors ?" into Japanese step by step. I’ll provide clues to help you, and you can try to piece it together. If you get stuck, let me know, and I’ll give more hints!

### Step 1: Understanding the Sentence
The sentence has two parts:
1. "Des ours à la porte" – This describes a situation: "Bears at the door."
2. "Avez-vous laissé les poubelles dehors ?" – This is a question: "Have you left the trash outside?"

In Japanese, we’ll need to connect these ideas naturally, likely with a structure that implies a cause or observation (bears at the door) and then a question (about the trash).

### Step 2: Vocabulary Table
Here’s a table with key words in their dictionary form (verbs, nouns, adverbs, adjectives only). You’ll need to figure out the particles and conjugations.

| Japanese | Romaji   | French         |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| 熊       | kuma     | ours (bear)   |
| 門       | mon      | porte (gate/door) |
| 置く     | oku      | laisser (to place/leave) |
| ゴミ箱   | gomibako | poubelle (trash can) |
| 外       | soto     | dehors (outside) |

### Step 3: Clues for Transcription
#### Part 1: "Des ours à la porte" (Bears at the door)
- "Bears" (熊) is the subject. What particle marks the subject in Japanese?
- "At the door" (門) is a location. What particle do you use for location with nouns like this?
- You might need a plural marker for "bears" – in Japanese, nouns don’t change for plural, but context or a word like "some" could help. For simplicity, we’ll assume it’s clear from context here.
- Think about how to say "there are bears at the door" – you might need a verb like "to be" (いる for living things), but since it’s dictionary form in the table, I’ll let you decide if it fits.

#### Part 2: "Avez-vous laissé les poubelles dehors ?" (Have you left the trash outside?)
- "Trash cans" (ゴミ箱) is the object. What particle marks the object of an action?
- "To leave" (置く) is the verb. This is a past-tense question in French ("avez-vous laissé" = "have you left"). How do you make a verb past tense in Japanese? (Hint: dictionary form ends in -u, past ends in something else.)
- "Outside" (外) is a location. What particle shows where the action happens?
- "Have you…?" – How do you make a question in Japanese? (Hint: It’s simple, often just a particle at the end.)

### Step 4: Possible Sentence Structure
Here’s a natural Japanese structure you can follow:
- [Subject + particle] [Location + particle] [Verb for "to be"] , [Object + particle] [Location + particle] [Verb in past tense + question particle]?
This could look like:  
"[Bears] [at the door] [are], [trash] [outside] [did you leave]?"
